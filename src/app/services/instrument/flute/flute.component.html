                  <p>Flute comes under woodwind group of musical family. Unlike the other musical instrument, flute is and aerophone or wind we can say wind based musical instrument which produced sound based on air pass from the hole(edge-blown aerophone).
                    A flute produces sound when a stream of air directed across a hole in the instrument creates a vibration of air at the hole.
                    This excites the air contained in the usually cylindrical resonant hole within flute. The flutist changes the pitch of the sound produced by opening and closing holes in the body of the instrument, thus changing the effective length of the resonator and its corresponding resonant frequency.

                      <p>Flute are the earliest extant of musical instrument means which was discovered in ancient days, as paleolithic instruments with hand-bored holes have been found. The oldest flute ever discovered may be a fragment  of the thigh bone of the teenage cave bear(species of bear found in Europe) with 2 to 4 holes about 43,000 years ago. The five-holed flute has a V-shaped mouthpiece and is made from a vulture wing bone.
